# Data_Mining_Project
## Breast Cancer Classification and Clustering Project
This project applies different classification and clustering techniques on a breast cancer dataset to identify the presence or absence of breast cancer. The following techniques are used:
</br>
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Decision Trees (DT)
3. Naive Bayes
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
</br>
The dataset used in this project is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, (Available on Kaggle) ![https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data]

### Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You will also need the following libraries:
```
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* seaborn
* matplotlib
```
You can install these libraries using pip, which is a package manager for Python.</br> To install these libraries, run the following command:
```
pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn matplotlib

```

### Conclusion
In this project, we applied various classification and clustering techniques on a breast cancer dataset. 
The results show that DT achieved the highest accuracy of all the classification algorithms.
The results of this project can be used to develop a breast cancer diagnostic tool based on machine learning techniques.
